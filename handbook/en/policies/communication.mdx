title: 🗣️ Communications
---

We have a weekly briefing with all the teams to discuss the roadmap and share important updates that are better communicated in person. Make sure you’ve received the calendar invite.

### Daily Communication Channels

We use WhatsApp groups and individual chats for day-to-day communications:
- **Group messages** (e.g., General, Engineering, and potentially Operations)
- **Direct messages** for one-to-one communication

### Long-Form Knowledge

We use internal [Docs](docs.aegister.com) for:
- Long-form entries
- Playbooks
- Common knowledge and policies

We use GitLab for:
- Milestone tracking across projects
- Task assignment via issues
- Reporting bugs and discussing technical aspects of the codebase
- Requesting new feature implementations

> ⚠️ **Warning:** Never share security tokens, customer PII (Personally Identifiable Information), or other sensitive information in GitLab.

### What to Use and When

- **Group message** — for things only relevant for today  
  _Example_: “Hey, xxxx is breaking for me, can someone help?”

- **GitLab Issues** — for discussions relevant over a few days or weeks  
  _Example_: RFCs, bug reports, meeting notes  
  _Note_: See thread etiquette below.

- **Direct message** — for messages intended for a single person  
  _Example_: “Hey, can you add me to service xxx?”

- **Docs** — for evergreen content useful to everyone, including future hires  
  _Example_: This page.
