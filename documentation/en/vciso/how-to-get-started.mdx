## 3. Navigating the "Cyber Assurance" Section

Once your license is confirmed, go to the **Cyber Assurance** section. Here you will find two main services:
- **Cyber Posture**: Displays the current status of security policy implementation or compliance standards. Check it out [here](https://app.aegister.com/cyber-assurance/).

- **Functionality**: Displays the implementation status of the security activities outlined in the security frameworks associated with your organization.

### 4.2 Association
- **Audience**: Reserved for security officers and owners.

## 5. Task Management

Tasks are categorized as follows:

- **Automated**: Scheduled scripts defined in the security framework that run periodically, with a log available to review past executions.
- **Self**: Tasks that require manual intervention.
