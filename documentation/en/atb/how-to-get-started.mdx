This guide outlines the complete procedure to connect and activate **Aegister Threat Blocker (ATB)**, whether deployed in series or in parallel. Follow these steps to ensure proper integration of the device with your security infrastructure.

## 1. Corporate Account Creation

- **Preliminary:**  
  Before proceeding, create an account for your organization on the **Aegister Cyber Console**. This step is essential for managing and monitoring the ATB device.
  
  **Note:** For devices pre-configured by Aegister for Partners, the organization has already been created. You can register directly on the platform [here](https://app.aegister.com/keycloak/realms/aegister/protocol/openid-connect/auth?response_type=code&scope=openid+email&client_id=webapp&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fapp.aegister.com%2Foidc%2Fcallback%2F&state=2im9Pol7ebxPo8NiOIOTe1BCEEIIUanY&nonce=aGU8lHJY54kTamcYrfg6Ar9tBgX3S9EN) using a corporate account by registering your email and password, or by using SSO. Once registered, request the necessary permissions from your Aegister contact to access the ATB dashboard.

## 2. Physical Connection of the Device

- **Network Connection:**  
  Physically connect the ATB device to your firewall using any available Ethernet port (**LAN1-4**).
  
- **Connection Confirmation:**  
  Once the device is connected, our team will receive a notification and begin the final remote configuration phase.

## 3. Technical Checks and Initial Configuration (by Aegister)

- **ATB–Cyber Console Connection Check:**  
  The Aegister team will verify that the ATB is properly communicating with the Cyber Console.
  
- **Aegister VPN Functionality Test:**  
  The team will confirm that the integrated VPN tunnel is operating correctly, ensuring remote access for maintenance and updates.
  
- **ATB Local IP Verification:**  
  Access the [ATB](https://app.aegister.com/perimeter-protection/aegister-threat-blocker/) section of your [Aegister Cyber Console](/documentation/acc/how-get-account) to verify that the ATB is connected and to view its **PUBLIC_IP** and **LOCAL_IP**.

- **Verification Call:**  
  If any issues arise, schedule a call with one of our experts to verify the device’s functionality and its connection with [app.aegister.com](https://app.aegister.com/perimeter-protection/aegister-threat-blocker//).

## 4. Final Steps for Parallel Connection (Generic Firewall)

Follow these steps:

1. **Access the Firewall Management Interface:**  
   Log in to your firewall’s management interface via its IP address or dedicated hostname using your administrator credentials.

2. **Connectivity Check:**  
   - Ensure that the ATB device is properly connected to the network and is reachable.  
   - The IP feed is available at:
     ```
     http://IP_ATB_LOCALE:8080/blacklist.txt
     ```
     Use this URL to verify that the IP blacklist is being correctly downloaded.

3. **Security Rules Configuration:**  
   - Create or modify firewall rules to block traffic to or from the IPs listed in the blacklist.  
   - Typically, you will need at least two rules: one for inbound traffic and one for outbound traffic, setting the action to "Deny" or "Block".

4. **Advanced Settings and Connection Security:**  
   - If your firewall supports automatic updates of the blacklist, configure it for periodic refreshes.  
   - For a secure (HTTPS) connection, provide a valid certificate to install on the ATB device, or request that we install a self-signed certificate.

5. **Logging and Monitoring Configuration:**  
   - Enable logging to monitor events related to your firewall rules.  
   - Configure log mirroring on UDP port **514** as supported by your firewall to ensure unwanted traffic is blocked.

6. **Final Verification and Functionality Test:**  
   - After configuration, download the blacklist again to confirm that it’s up-to-date and that a green check mark (or equivalent indicator) is visible.  
   - Perform connectivity tests to ensure the blocking rules are active.

7. **Documentation and Support:**  
   - If you experience any issues, contact our support team for further assistance.

## 4.b Final Steps for Parallel Connection (Firewall: Fortigate)

If you are connecting ATB in parallel to an existing Fortigate firewall, follow these steps:

1. **Access the Fortigate Management Interface:**  
   Log in to your Fortigate firewall’s control panel.

2. **Create the Security Fabric Object:**  
   - Create a Security Fabric object named **“Aegister_Blacklist”**.  
   - Use the link:
     ```
     https://IP_LOCALE_ATB/blacklist.txt
     ```
     Verify that the status shows as "green" and that the list is downloaded correctly.

3. **Firewall Policy Rules Configuration:**  
   - **Rule 1:**  
     - **From:** Any  
     - **To:** Aegister_Blacklist  
     - Assign a high rule ID and set the action to **Deny**.
     
   - **Rule 2:**  
     - **From:** Aegister_Blacklist  
     - **To:** Any  
     - Also configure this rule in Deny mode with a high rule ID.

4. **Enable Logging:**  
   Activate logging on UDP port **514** to monitor events related to these rules.

5. **Note for Fortigate:**  
   To ensure connection security, you must install a certificate on the ATB device, as Fortigate accepts only **HTTPS** connections for Security Fabric objects. Additionally, specify the full filename `blacklist.txt` instead of the default `/blacklist`.
