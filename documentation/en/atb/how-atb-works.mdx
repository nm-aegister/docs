Aegister Threat Blocker (ATB) is a versatile device that can be configured in two modes to address different perimeter security requirements.

## 1. Series Mode

Series mode is the recommended solution for customers who do not have any other perimeter protection devices. In this scenario:

- **Placement:**  
  ATB is deployed in line with the corporate gateway, acting as the **primary firewall**.

- **Configuration:**  
  The device is set up as a PFSense-based system, incorporating:
  - The necessary security rules for comprehensive enterprise protection.
  - Aegister’s threat intelligence for real-time threat analysis.
  - An integrated VPN to facilitate remote access, which is essential for maintenance and updates.

This configuration centralizes security, making ATB the pivotal point for traffic control and protection.

## 2. Parallel Mode

Parallel mode is the most common configuration for organizations that already have an existing firewall (e.g., Sophos, Fortigate, SonicWall). In this case:

- **Placement:**  
  ATB is implemented alongside the main firewall.

- **Functionality:**  
  In parallel mode, the device serves a dual purpose:
  - **Provision of Threat Intelligence:**  
    ATB delivers security updates and threat information to the primary firewall, enhancing its detection and prevention capabilities.
  - **Optional Log Mirroring:**  
    It can mirror logs, allowing the Aegister Cyber Console to display the latest 10M events and the IP addresses blocked by our threat intelligence. This feature provides detailed visibility and advanced control over security operations.
  - **Integrated VPN:**  
    Ensures remote access for essential maintenance and updates.

## Conclusion

ATB can be configured to meet the specific needs of your organization:
- **Series Mode:** Ideal for a centralized, integrated security solution when no other perimeter devices are present.
- **Parallel Mode:** Best suited for augmenting an existing firewall with ATB’s advanced capabilities, enhancing security and monitoring through log mirroring.

Choose the mode that best fits your environment to fully leverage the potential of the Aegister Threat Blocker.
