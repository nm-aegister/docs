# How Aegister Cloud Defender Works

Aegister Cloud Defender secures web applications by analyzing inbound traffic in real time. The process unfolds in several key stages:

![How It Works](/images/cloud-defender-how.png)

## Connection and Integration

- The domain **secure.aegister.com** connects to Cloud Defender via the **Cloud_External_IP_Address**.
- The system combines **Cloud WAF** and **OneFirewall Threat Prevention** solutions, delivering multi-layered protection against threats.

## Request Handling

- When a client sends a request, for example to **client1.domain1.com**:
  - **client1.domain1.com** is set up as a **CNAME for secure.aegister.com**.
  - The request includes critical details, such as the originating IP address and the **X-Forwarded-For** header, which trace the traffic's path.

## Traffic Analysis

- Client traffic flows through Cloud Defender (depicted as the **"blue tunnel"** in the diagram) where it undergoes:
  - **Threat Intelligence Analysis:** Continuously updated WAF rules evaluate the risk associated with each request.
  - **Traffic Evaluation:** Additional queries to client domains or hostnames verify the trafficâ€™s origin and authenticity.

## Decision and Action

- Based on the analysis:
  - If the traffic is deemed safe, access is **granted** to the endpoint associated with **client1.domain1.com**.
  - If a high risk level or a malicious IP is detected, the system **automatically blocks** the request, denying access.

This workflow ensures that only legitimate traffic reaches your web applications, dynamically and effectively protecting clients from cyber threats.
