## 2. DNS Update

Once Aegister configures Cloud Defender, you will need to update your domain's DNS records. Follow these steps:

1. **Access the DNS Control Panel:**  
   Log in to your DNS provider or hosting control panel where you manage your domain records.

2. **Modify the A or CNAME Record:**  
   Update the primary record for the web application (whether an A record or a CNAME) so that it points to:  
   `secure.aegister.com`

3. **Confirmation and Propagation:**  
   Save your changes and wait for DNS propagation, which typically takes between 1 and 24 hours depending on your provider.

## 3. Final Verification

After DNS propagation, perform the following tests to ensure that your site is properly protected by Aegister Cloud Defender:

- **Browsing Test:**  
  Visit your domain (e.g., www.example.com) to verify that the site loads correctly.

- **Traffic Monitoring:**  
  If available, request reports or logs from Aegister to confirm that traffic is being routed through the Cloud Defender platform.
