  Instantly blocks requests identified as malicious.
  
- **Score Engine:**  
  Prioritizes threats by minimizing false positives and optimizing response actions.
  
- **Network Threats Retriever:**  
  Continuously updates the rules, signatures, and databases used by the other modules.

## Distinctive Features

### Multicloud Infrastructure
- **Multicloud Architecture:**  
  Cloud Defender is primarily developed on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and integrated with globally distributed resources from other providers.  
  This approach ensures:
  - Real-time threat analysis and detection.
