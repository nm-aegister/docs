### Can specific paths or IP addresses be excluded from WAF protection?

Yes, you can configure exclusions for specific paths or use regular expressions to define areas to be excluded. This option prevents the filter from interfering with internal or critical services.

### What is the IP address used by the Cloud Defender CDN?

To ensure optimal security and prevent WAF bypass, you can configure the filter to accept requests exclusively from our CDN. The IP address to whitelist is 34.110.162.74 (secure.aegister.com).

### Is it possible to downgrade from HTTPS to HTTP between the WAF and the protected site?

Yes, a downgrade from HTTPS to HTTP between the WAF and the protected site is possible, although this approach is not considered best practice in terms of security.

### What advantages does Cloud Defender offer compared to solutions like AWS Cloudfront + WAF?

Cloud Defender provides traditional features such as IP masking, DDoS protection, a conventional WAF, and caching. Its key differentiator is its ability to automatically block traffic from malicious sources using threat intelligence data from [OneFirewall](https://onefirewall.com/intelligence.html). For example, if an attacker is identified during an attack on another target, the system will block access from that same source to your site.
