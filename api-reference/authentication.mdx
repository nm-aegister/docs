## Authentication Methods

Our API supports two methods for authentication using the `X-Aegister-Token`. You can choose either method based on your preference or use case.

### 1. Header-Based Authentication

In this method, you include the `X-Aegister-Token` in the headers of your HTTP request. This is typically preferred as it keeps the token out of the URL, enhancing security.

**Example Request:**

```http
GET /api/v1/resource HTTP/1.1
Host: app.aegister.com
X-Aegister-Token: your_token_here
```

**Curl Example:**

```bash
curl -H "X-Aegister-Token: your_token_here" https://app.aegister.com/api/v1/resource
```

### 2. Query Parameter Authentication

Alternatively, you can include the `X-Aegister-Token` as a query parameter in the URL. This method is useful in scenarios where setting request headers is not feasible.

**Example Request:**

```http
GET /api/v1/resource?X-Aegister-Token=your_token_here HTTP/1.1
Host: app.aegister.com
```

**Curl Example:**

```bash
curl https://app.aegister.com/api/v1/resource?X-Aegister-Token=your_token_here
```
